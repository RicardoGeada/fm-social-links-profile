## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TypeScript
- SCSS
- Jest

### What I learned

In this small project, I learned how to apply the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology to write cleaner, more reusable CSS.

I also learned how to deploy a React app to GitHub Pages.
I found a working solution using the gh-pages package. I updated the package.json with the correct homepage URL and added deploy scripts:

"homepage": "https://<username>.github.io/<repository>",
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
I also configured the base path in vite.config.ts:

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/<repository>/',
})
This setup allowed me to successfully deploy the app using:

npm run deploy
Finally I just needed to activate Github Pages for the repository:

Go to your repository on GitHub
Navigate to Settings â†’ Pages
Under Source, select:
Branch: gh-pages
Folder: / (root)

### Continued development

Going forward, I would like to deepen my understanding of the BEM methodology and continue improving the quality and structure of my code.
